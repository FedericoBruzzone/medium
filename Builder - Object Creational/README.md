# Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representation.

A reader for the RTF (Rich Text Format) document exchange format should be able to convert RTF to many text formats. The problem is the number of possible conversions is open-ended.

A solution is to configure the RTFReader class with TextConverter object that converts RTF to another textual representation. As the RTFReader perses the RTF document, it uses the TextConverter to perform the conversion. Whenever the RTFReader recognizes an RTF token, it issues a request to the TextConverter to convert the token.

Subclasses of TextConverter specialize in different conversions and formats. For example, ASCIIConverter ignores requests to convert anything except plain text.

Each kind of converter class takes the mechanism for creating and assembling a complex object and puts it behind an abstract interface. The converter is separate from the reader.

The Builder pattern captures all these relationships. Each converter is called a **builder** in the pattern, and the reader is called the **director**. The Builder pattern separates the algorithm for interpreting a textual format from how a converted format gets created and represented.
